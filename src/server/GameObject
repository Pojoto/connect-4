--make new game object with those 2 players as parameters

--board matrix is a variable

--have methods to call a player turn whcih will send a remote event to the player

--player sends reote event back signaling end of their return
	
--	main script to catch these client calls

--game object also passed as a paramaeter whenever a remote event is called


--when server catches client call, it takes the game object passed and calls the next turn of the next player

--this is done after checking if the board state is finished or not
